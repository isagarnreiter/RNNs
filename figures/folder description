1. 

Network with sparse connectivity, some input to neurons with colossal projections and some input to inhibitory neurons.

Task 1: 
stim range: 0.0 - 0.6
one stimulus is larger than the other -> output(stronger stim) = 1 and output(weaker stim) = 0
both stimuli are equal -> the network randomly chooses either one or the other output 
When both stimuli = 0 -> both output go to 0



2. 

Network with sparse connectivity, no input to neurons with colossal projections, some input to inhibitory neurons.

Task 1.


3. 

Network with sparse connectivity, some input to neurons with colossal projections and some input to inhibitory neurons.

Task 1 
+ every 8th trial is a catch trial (both stim = 0)
